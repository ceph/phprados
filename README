** PHPRADOS **
phprados is a PHP extension for librados ( http://www.ceph.com/docs/master/api/librados/ ).

The extension wraps the C API of librados into a extension, where almost all the native methods are implemented.

** LIMITATIONS **
The extension should work on both 32 and 64-bit systems, but due to PHP's engine it might now work well with very large objects.

Also, the selfmanaged snapshots are not implemented in the extension since their usage is pretty rare.

** METHODS / FUNCTIONS **
For a full overview of the available functions, open a terminal and run:

$ php --re rados

Real code examples can be taken from the Unit tests.

** HELP **
phprados comes as it is, but there could always be bugs or issues.

For questions, please visit Ceph's IRC channel (#ceph on irc.oftc.net) or contact the maintainers directly.

** EXAMPLES **
There is an examples directory which contains some examples.

You probably want to look at the unit tests though, since they will be well
maintained.

** UNIT TESTING **
Unit tests are available in the "test" directory.

These tests are all written for PHPUnit and require PHPUnit to be installed.

This can be done using PEAR:
$ pear config-set auto_discover 1
$ pear install pear.phpunit.de/PHPUnit

Running the tests is simple:
$ export id="admin"
$ export key="your-key-found-in-your-ceph.keyring"
$ export mon_host="ip-of-your-monitor-host"
$ phpunit
