1. Before installing this extension, please make sure your system meets the following requirements:
* At least PHP 5.2
* You have librados2(-dev), libcrush1 and libatomic-ops-dev installed

* You have a C/C++ compiler on your system

2. Build the extension:
$ cd phprados

If you would only require the procedural interface to build leave out the --enable--oo.

3. Loading the extension
Add "extension=rados.so" to your php.ini

On Debian/Ubuntu systems:

$ echo "extension=rados.so" > /etc/php5/conf.d/rados.ini

4. Verify the extension is loaded
Run a phpinfo(); this should show the RADOS extension being loaded

$ php --ri rados
$ php --re rados
